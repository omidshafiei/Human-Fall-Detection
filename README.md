# Human-Fall-Detection
Using SVM to detect human fall based on ambient vibration signature
## Description
According to the aging of the baby boomers, providing an environment for the elderly to live independently is a significant concern from different perspectives. Developing a robust and applicable human unintentional fall detection system is a significant step in this way and has been studied by using different approaches recently. Using the floor vibration signal is an unobtrusive approach that has a comparable result with accurate and intrusive techniques like vision base and wearable devices. In this study, first, we extracted the temporal and spectral features of the vibration signal, and then we used Gaussian processes classifier to detect the human fall signal among the seven other objects fall.
